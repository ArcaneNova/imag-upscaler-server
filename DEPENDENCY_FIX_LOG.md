# Real-ESRGAN Dependency Fix Log
## July 3, 2025

### Issues Fixed

1. **Dependency Conflict between torch and torchvision**
   - Error: `torchvision 0.16.2 depends on torch==2.1.2` but had `torch==2.1.1`
   - Fix: Updated dependency specifications to use compatible version ranges instead of exact pins
   - Example: Changed `torch==2.1.2` to `torch>=2.1.0,<2.2.0`

2. **Duplicate opencv-python dependency**
   - Issue: Both `opencv-python-headless` and `opencv-python` were listed
   - Fix: Removed the duplicate `opencv-python` dependency as `opencv-python-headless` is preferred for server environments

3. **Torchvision Deprecation Warning**
   - Warning: `torchvision.transforms.functional_tensor` module is deprecated in 0.15 and will be removed in 0.17
   - Fix: Updated to compatible torchvision version that supports the newer API

### Changes Made

- Updated all dependencies to use flexible version constraints with minimum and maximum version bounds
- This approach allows pip to resolve dependency conflicts more easily while still maintaining compatibility
- Example: `package==X.Y.Z` â†’ `package>=X.Y.0,<X.(Y+1).0`

### Benefits

1. **Better Dependency Resolution**: Pip can now resolve dependencies without conflicts
2. **Future Compatibility**: Minor updates are automatically accepted
3. **Stability**: Upper bounds prevent major version changes that might break compatibility
4. **Easier Updates**: Simpler to update individual dependencies when needed

### Testing

After implementing these changes, ensure the following are tested:
1. Building the Docker image succeeds without dependency errors
2. The API server starts correctly
3. Image upscaling functionality works as expected
4. The system continues to function if Redis is unavailable
